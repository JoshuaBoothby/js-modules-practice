### export/import vs module.exports/require

    Key Technical Difference:

- export/import is part of the ES module system and supports static analysis, enabling features like tree-shaking, while module.exports/require is part of the CommonJS module system and is dynamically evaluated at runtime.

  Why Choose ES Modules for Modern Node Projects?

- ES modules are the standard for JavaScript, offering better compatibility with modern tools, browsers, and features like top-level await and improved performance through static imports.
